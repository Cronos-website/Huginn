# Huginn

> Agent-pilotable fleet management for Linux VMs — a central hub, lightweight Go
> workers, a web dashboard, and an MCP façade so an AI agent can drive the fleet.

Huginn lets you manage a fleet of Linux VMs from one place: enroll machines with a
one-line installer, approve them from a dashboard, run controlled actions (or
opt-in unrestricted commands), keep workers up to date, and audit everything. An
[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server exposes the same capabilities to an
external AI agent (e.g. "Hermes") without duplicating any business logic.

> **Status:** hub + Go worker + MCP + React dashboard, with docker-compose and
> Kubernetes manifests for the hub. This is a remote command-execution system —
> read [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) before exposing it.

```

- **Hub** (`/hub`) — FastAPI + PostgreSQL. The source of truth: inventory,
  enrollment, authz, audit, the target worker version, and task routing.
- **Worker** (`/worker`) — a single static Go binary installed natively on each VM
  via systemd. It long-polls the hub for tasks (NAT-friendly), runs them locally,
  and reports results. No runtime dependencies.
- **MCP server** (`/mcp`) — a thin façade over the hub's REST API exposing tools
  for an external agent. No direct worker access, no duplicated logic.
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) — a React SPA (Vite + TypeScript) with a
  distinctive "raven control-console" UI: a home overview, fleet roster, per-node
  actions/updates/unrestricted shell, custom tags/groups, scheduled commands,
  enrollment + MCP tokens, user management, and the audit log with hash-chain
  verification. Served same-origin behind the reverse proxy (no baked hub URL).

By default the worker **pulls** work from the hub over a single outbound HTTPS
connection, so it works behind NAT. A push listener can be enabled per-VM when the
machine is directly routable.

## Authentication

Multiple sign-in methods, all feeding the same admin / operator / read-only RBAC:

- **Local** password (Argon2id), **LDAP/LDAPS**, and **OIDC/SSO** (tested with
  Authentik).
- **Two-factor**: TOTP authenticator apps (with single-use backup codes) and
  **WebAuthn passkeys** for phishing-resistant passwordless login. 2FA can be
  required for admins.
- **SSO-first**: when OIDC is enabled the password form is hidden by default and
  re-enabled only via an explicit "unsafe" flag — never locking you out when OIDC
  is off. See [docs/auth.md](docs/auth.md).

## Quickstart (local)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sunderrrr/Huginn.git
cd Huginn/deploy 
cp .env.prod.example .env          # then edit secrets
vi .env                            # or nano .env
docker compose up --build
```

This starts PostgreSQL, the hub (`:8000`), the dashboard (`:5173`), and the MCP
server (`:9000`). A first admin user is bootstrapped from
`HUGINN_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_*`; log in to the dashboard with those credentials.

Enroll a VM (after generating an enrollment token via the API/dashboard):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://<hub>/install.sh | HUB_URL=https://<hub> TOKEN=<token> bash
# add -k if the hub uses a self-signed/internal cert (see docs/enrollment.md)
```

The hub serves `install.sh` and the worker binaries itself, so this works without
a GitHub release. The VM appears as **PENDING**; approve it before it can receive
any command.

For production you can choose **Docker Compose + Caddy** (single host, automatic
HTTPS) or **Kubernetes** — both are first-class; you don't need k8s. See
[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md).

## Repository layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `hub/` | FastAPI hub (Python 3.12+, SQLAlchemy 2 async, Alembic) |
| `worker/` | Go worker daemon (static binary, systemd) |
| `mcp/` | MCP server (Python, FastMCP) — façade over the hub |
| `dashboard/` | React SPA (Vite + TypeScript) |
| `deploy/` | docker-compose + Kubernetes manifests |
| `scripts/` | `install.sh` one-liner installer |
| `docs/` | documentation |

## Security

Auth on every endpoint, optional 2FA (TOTP + WebAuthn passkeys) with TOTP secrets
encrypted at rest, timing-safe secret comparison, TLS enforced for hub↔worker in
prod, secrets hashed at rest, no shell construction on the worker (separated argv,
never `sh -c`), opt-in + audited unrestricted mode, rate limits and body caps on
execution, SSRF allowlist on update sources, and an append-only hash-chained audit
log. Details in [docs/security.md](docs/security.md). Report vulnerabilities per
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
